\## Domain

Logistics \& Supply Chain



\## Problem Statement

Create a system to track shipments across supply chain stages.  

Each shipment should have:

\- A unique ID

\- Current status

\- History of updates



\## Learning Goals

\- Understand object-oriented programming (OOP)

\- Work with multiple classes (`Shipment`, `Tracker`)

\- Implement history tracking with timestamps

\- Practice file handling \& reporting

\- Handle custom exceptions
